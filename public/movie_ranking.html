<h1>The Best Movies According To Marcus</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jaws</h3>
<p>
    The music that will stay in your mind till you die.<br />
    The fear of encountering a shark when you go swimming.<br />
    For some reason I always get hungry after watching this movie.<br />
</p>

<h3>Planet of The Apes</h3>
<P>
    The original movies from the 70's. <br /> 
    Without CGI, and big budgets, <br /> 
    the movie was better than the newest versions.<br />
</P>

<h3>Green Lantern</h3>
<p>Green is my favorite color.</p>
